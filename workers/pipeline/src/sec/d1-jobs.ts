 * workflow that dies in between — the model provider rate-limiting a whole batch does exactly this
 * — leaves `running` as the newest row for that filing forever. `shouldAnalyze` only proceeds on a
 * missing or `failed` status, so without a lease that filing is skipped by every later scheduled
 * run and silently stops being re-analysed.
 *
 * Set well above the slowest single-filing analysis observed in production (~50 minutes, a large
