 * database whose CHECK constraint still rejected it, so every fundamentals sync failed on the
 * constraint while the stored snapshot stayed a catalog version behind — which in turn marked it
 * permanently stale, so every single request queued another doomed sync. This check compares the
 * migrations in the build against the ones the database records and refuses a deploy that would
 * put newer code on an older schema.
